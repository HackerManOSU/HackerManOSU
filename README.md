# Hellurrr 👋

I'm Zane Garvey!

## About me

I am a student at Oregon State University currently studying... Computer Science (as I'm sure you could imagine)

When I am not at my desk coding, I like to be creative in other ways, typically outside:
- I love playing the guitar (acoustic **and** electric) 🎸🎵
- I enjoy fishing, expecially with friends! 🎣
- I love dirt biking 🏍️ and snowboarding 🏂🏔️
- I'm really into learning about and researching (and wearing!) watches ⌚
- I am a **HUGE** MMA fan and I train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu 🥋
- I have always been into working out and even own my **own** supplement business 🏋️

## What I'm Currently Learning 💻
- CS 271 Computer Architecture and Assembly Language
- CS 290 Web Development
- Studying for COMPTIA Sec+ and Google Cybersecurity+
